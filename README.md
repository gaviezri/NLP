-- NLP --
Here you can find all my NLP projects.
this domain of computer's science is one of my favorite as it requires solid understanding of linear algebra
which can be used to manipulate the data in an interesting way.
I personally thinks the most interesting one to check out is the clustering and data extraction from unhandled prompts. 
enjoy.
